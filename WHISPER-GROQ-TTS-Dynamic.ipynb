However, exceptions\n","can be forcefully triggered and handled through\n","program code. In this chapter, we will learn about\n","exception handling in Python programs.\n","1.2 Syntax ErrorS\n","Syntax errors are detected when we have not\n","followed the rules of the particular programming\n","language while writing a program. These errors are\n","also known as parsing errors. On encountering a\n","syntax error, the interpreter does not execute the\n","program unless we rectify the errors, save and\n","2024-25\n","Chapter 1.indd 1 18-Jun-21 2:27:38 PMrerun the program.

Such types of errors might\n","disrupt the normal execution of the program and are\n","called exceptions.\n","An exception is a Python object that represents an\n","error. When an error occurs during the execution of a\n","program, an exception is said to have been raised. Such\n","an exception needs to be handled by the programmer\n","so that the program does not terminate abnormally.\n","Therefore, while designing a program, a programmer\n","may anticipate such erroneous situations that may arise\n","during its execution and can address them by including\n","appropriate code to handle that exception.\n","It is to be noted that SyntaxError shown at Figures\n","1.1 and 1.3 is also an exception. But, all other exceptions\n","are generated when a program is syntactically correct.\n","1.4 BuIlt-In ExcEptIonS\n","Commonly occurring exceptions are usually defined\n","in the compiler/interpreter. These are called built-in\n","exceptions.\n","Python’s standard library is an extensive collection\n","of built-in exceptions that deals with the commonly\n","occurring errors (exceptions) by providing the\n","standardized solutions for such errors. On the occurrence\n","of any built-in exception, the appropriate exception\n","handler code is executed which displays the reason\n","along with the raised exception name.

Programmers can also forcefully\n","raise exceptions in a program using the raise and assert\n","statements. Once an exception is raised, no further\n","statement in the current block of code is executed. So,\n","raising an exception involves interrupting the normal\n","flow execution of program and jumping to that part of\n","the program (exception handler code) which is written\n","to handle such exceptional situations.\n","1.5.1 The Statement\n","raise\n","The raise statement can be used to throw an exception.\n","The syntax of raise statement is:\n","raise exception-name[(optional argument)]\n","The argument is generally a string that is displayed\n","when the exception is raised.

The statement\n","IndexError\n","following the raise statement will not be executed.

This is a structured block of text that\n","contains information about the sequence of function\n","calls that have been made in the branch of execution of\n","code in which the exception was raised. In Figure 1.6,\n","the error has been encountered in the most recently\n","called function that has been executed.\n","Figure 1.6: Use of raise statement with built-in exception\n","Note: We will learn about Stack in Chapter 3.\n","1.5.2 The Statement\n","assert\n","An assert statement in Python is used to test an\n","expression in the program code. If the result after testing\n","comes false, then the exception is raised. This statement\n","is generally used in the beginning of the function or after\n","a function call to check for valid input. The syntax for\n","assert statement is:\n","assert Expression[,arguments]\n","On encountering an assert statement, Python\n","evaluates the expression given immediately after\n","the assert keyword. If this expression is false, an\n","AssertionError exception is raised which can be handled\n","like any other exception. Consider the code given in\n","Program 1-1.\n","Program 1-1 Use of assert statement\n","print(\"use of assert statement\")\n","def negativecheck(number):\n","assert(number>=0), \"OOPS...

The output of the code is\n","shown in Figure 1.7.\n","1.6 HandlIng ExcEptIonS\n","Each and every exception has to be handled by the\n","programmer to avoid the program from crashing\n","abruptly. This is done by writing additional code in\n","a program to give proper messages or instructions to\n","the user on encountering an exception. This process is\n","known as exception handling.\n","1.6.1 Need for Exception Handling\n","Exception handling is being used not only in Python\n","programming but in most programming languages like\n","C++, Java, Ruby, etc. It is a useful technique that helps\n","in capturing runtime errors and handling them so as to\n","avoid the program getting crashed. Following are some\n","Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii eXCeption Handling in pytHon 7\n","2024-25\n","Chapter 1.indd 7 18-Jun-21 2:27:39 PMof the important points regarding exceptions and their\n","handling:\n","• Python categorises exceptions into distinct types so\n","that specific exception handlers (code to handle that\n","particular exception) can be created for each type.\n","• Exception handlers separate the main logic of the\n","program from the error detection and correction\n","code. The segment of code where there is any\n","possibility of error or exception, is placed inside one\n","block. The code to be executed in case the exception\n","has occurred, is placed inside another block. These\n","statements for detection and reporting the exception\n","do not affect the main logic of the program.\n","• The compiler or interpreter keeps track of the exact\n","position where the error has occurred.\n","• Exception handling can be done for both user-defined\n","and built-in exceptions.\n","1.6.2 Process of Handling Exception\n","When an error occurs, Python interpreter creates an\n","object called the exception object. This object contains\n","information about the error like its type, file name and\n","position in the program where the error has occurred.\n","The object is handed over to the runtime system so that\n","A runtime system\n","it can find an appropriate code to handle this particular\n","refers to the\n","execution of the exception. This process of creating an exception object\n","statements given in and handing it over to the runtime system is called\n","the program. It is a throwing an exception. It is important to note that\n","complex mechanism\n","when an exception occurs while executing a particular\n","consisting of\n","program statement, the control jumps to an exception\n","hardware and\n","software that handler, abandoning execution of the remaining\n","comes into action program statements.\n","as soon as the\n","program, written in The runtime system searches the entire program\n","any programming for a block of code, called the exception handler that\n","language, is put for\n","can handle the raised exception. It first searches for\n","execution.\n","the method in which the error has occurred and the\n","exception has been raised. If not found, then it searches\n","the method from which this method (in which exception\n","was raised) was called. This hierarchical search in\n","reverse order continues till the exception handler is\n","found. This entire list of methods is known as call stack.\n","When a suitable handler is found in the call stack, it\n","is executed by the runtime process. This process of\n","8 Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii eXCeption Handling in pytHon\n","2024-25\n","Chapter 1.indd 8 18-Jun-21 2:27:39 PMexecuting a suitable handler is known as catching the\n","exception. If the runtime system is not able to find an\n","appropriate exception after searching all the methods in\n","the call stack, then the program execution stops.\n","The flowchart in Figure 1.8 describes the exception\n","handling process.\n","Figure 1.8: Steps of handling exception\n","1.6.3 Catching Exceptions\n","An exception is said to be caught when a code that is\n","designed to handle a particular exception is executed.\n","Exceptions, if any, are caught in the block and\n","try\n","Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii eXCeption Handling in pytHon 9\n","2024-25\n","Chapter 1.indd 9 07-Sep-21 4:24:55 PMhandled in the block.
